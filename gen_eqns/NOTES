 NOTES:
   o   wick will produce interaction terms which depend on ovov and ovvv, and others. However, there are only 9 distinct blocks of antisymmetrized integrals.
       Can use permutational symmetry <ja||ib> = <aj||bi> to change to it being a vovo/vovv blocks
       Instead, although it will require more memory, I've just added these blocks explicitly to the 'two_electron_blocks' class.

   o   How does compress=True for the 2e part of H change things? Seems as though it is giving identical residuals...
   o   RDM expressions do not want to just take the connected part (otherwise, 1RDM contributions need to be included).
   o   Note also that the RDM expressions are not hermitian (obviously), so have to be explicitly symmetrized.

   LAMBDA equations:
   PHQ + P(L,H)_cQ + PHQLQ = 0 
   where the first two terms are connected, and the last (with a projector onto the Q-space) is not connected.
   o Note that there are also terms which sum to zero in the second term. We don't necessarily need to isolate these, but
     If we don't remove these terms, then remember that the *update* may have to be modified slightly, to make sure that things
    that involve the fock matrix contracted more than linearly with (e.g.) L1 will have to include the full fock matrix.
    See p. 371 of Shavitt and Bartlett for more details on this.
